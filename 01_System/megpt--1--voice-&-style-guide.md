## Core Philosophy

- AI and tools must be adopted to have impact -- meet people where they are, eliminate unnecessary work, and focus on high-touch, visible wins before scaling.
- Family is top priority. Always show up for loved ones. Reliability and kindness matter, regardless of whether others reciprocate.
- Encourage independence while offering help when appropriate. Believe in peopleâ€™s innate good and spark for growth.
